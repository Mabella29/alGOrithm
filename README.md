## Data Structures

Data Structures are representations of data sets in a way which makes storage and performing of operations of data very easy.

### Classification of Data Structures

- #### _[Linear](data-structures/linear)_
  - [List](data-structures/linear/list/list.go) : is an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.
  - [Set](data-structures/linear/set/set.go) : is an abstract data type can store unique values without any particular order.
  - [Tuple](data-structures/linear/tuple/tuple.go) : is a finite ordered list (sequence) of elements. Tuple is a reference type.
  - [Queue](data-structures/linear/queue/queue.go) : is an abstract data type that implements a First-In-First-Out (`FIFO`) queue of generic items.
  - [Stack](data-structures/linear/stack/stack.go) : is an abstract data type that operates on the concept of the Last-In-First-Out (`LIFO`) principle.
  - [Heap](data-structures/linear/heap/heap.go) : is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: for any node, the value of that node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

The list is a reference type.
      - [Circular Double Linked List](data-structures/heterogeneous/linkedList/circularLinkedList/circularDoubleLinkedList/circularDoubleLinkedList.go) : is a data structure which has the last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous. The list is a reference type.
  - [Ordered List](data-structures/heterogeneous/orderedList/orderedList.go) : is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes, each node having a value and a reference to the next node. The list is a reference type.
  - [Unordered List](data-structures/heterogeneous/unorderedList/unorderedList.go) : is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes, each node having a value and a reference to the next node. The list is a reference type.

## Algorithms

Algorithm is a set of instructions that describes how to get something done.
